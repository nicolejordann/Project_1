# Project_1

This biotechnology company needs to evaluate a new raw material to potentially be used it its emulsion solution. 

The emulsion solution is composite of water-based media broth micelles suspended in an oil solution. Each micell is used for growing and analyzing a bacterial cell with the hopes of diagnosing infections in future pateints.

The key part of the oil solution that is resposible for maintaining its micellular formation is called a surfactant.

The raw materials used to make the surfactant stongly impact how stable the emulsion will be. If the emulsion is weak, all of the micelles will collapse into one giant mass and be regarded as useless. 

This company needs to test a new raw material to see if it creates a stable emulsion. If it does indeed create a stable emulsion, then the company will move forward and purchase $30,000 of the new raw material. 



Experimental design:
The approach to analyzing the strength of the emulsion is by using lung samples collected from humans
